				<span class="firstLetter">T</span>he Endless Wanderer sets for his long journey through knwowledge and aesthetic! On his way, he will collect geniuses and magicians to imagine, create and, surely, discover the inner beauty and structure of the world.
				</p>
				<p>
				Each 3 months, The Endless Wanderer will organise a <b>priced, juried and themed art <a href="#contests">contest</a></b> to encourage the creation. Because our world is beautiful but, yet, uncomprehensible to all, themes of contests are about its secrets. But also, about the discoveries and those who discovered them, i.e. scientists of all times and subjects. The Endless Wanderer aims for artists, and everyone else, to comprehend the slightiest phenomenon of nature. As we, we can't always understand scientific results and analysis, therefore with a brief explanation, <b>artists can create their own understanding</b> of them. Or even, turn them around to produce new discoveries.
				</p>
				<p>
				As example, <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maurits Cornelis Escher</a> has been inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_stairs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Impossible stairs"</a> from Lionel and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roger Penrose</a> who had been inspired by Escher's work themselves. A collaboration between artist and scientists which led to a new aesthetic, a wonderful art work and better understanding of optical illusions.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Endless Wanderer will install a public place, a forum, for scientists and artists to discuss and share ideas. But, meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheEndlessWanderer/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/TEW2121" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twitter @TEW2121</a> accounts can be used for this purpose. 
				</p>
				<p>
				To artists, please read our <a href="#contests">contests</a> themes, create and <a href="#contests">submit</a> your artwork.<br>
				To scientists, please continue to discover, observe our <a href="#permanentExh">permanent exhibition</a> to get inspired in researches and share your thoughts and ideas that you'd want to be represented.

			<div class="contest_desc">
				<h3>
				Theme: Share DNA, share love
				</h3>
				<p>
				 We all know the traditional way of DNA sharing, i.e. reproduction but this contest is about a rather unusual one.
				</p>
				<p>
				We'd like to introduce you the Tardigrade or known also as the Water Bear.<br>
				Take a Grizzly bear, add 4 legs, shave it and shrink it to between 0.05 to 1.5mm (0.0019 to 0.039 inches) and you get a water bear or Tardigrade. This is not a large bacteria, it belongs to the animalia kingdom and it is one of the most resistant organism; it still can live at temperatures a little bit above absolute zero (−273.15 °C  or −459.67 °F) and it does live at way above boiling water temperature (100 °C or 212 °F). It can also stand 6 times greater pressure than found in deep oceans, radiations 100 times higher than our lethal dose and it can withstand outerspace vaccum. It feeds on algae or small invertebrates but it can go without food for 10 years by drying itself up to 3% of its water. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Already awarded with many survival skills, it has been recently discovered that Tardigrades are the organism with the biggest percentage of foreign DNA; 17.5%. Most of animals, including humans, have less than 1% of DNA borrowed from other organisms. The Water Bear takes his DNA from plants or fungis through what is called <b>the horizontal gene transfer</b>. While the Tardigrade dries itself, its DNA is scattered to pieces; when it rehydrates, his cell nucleus are permeable and can let through and assimilate other organisms DNA. It is believed that this particularity makes him the champion he is.
				</p>
				<p>
				This is this particularity which The Endless Wanderer wants to see emphasized. DNA is the base code for all organism and defines the differences but the example of the Water Bear shows that those differences, barriers can be overcome to create a better and a stronger being. And what if we, humans, could take DNA from other species too?

			<h2>2016 Spring Contest</h2>

			<img class="contest_pic" id="whitehole" src="Images/whitehole.jpg" alt="A white hole" /> 
			
			<div class="contest_desc">
				<h3>
				Theme: White holes, black holes and wormholes
				</h3>
				<p>
				Celebrating the 100 years of Ludwig Flamm examination of Schwarzschild’s solution (black holes) to Einstein’s general relativity field equations, leading to the theory of whiteholes.
				</p>
				<p>
				A white hole is the theoritical time reversal of a black hole. While a black hole "sucks up" matter, a white hole would eject it. Flamm also considered the mathematical possibility of a connection between "entrance" black hole and "exit" white hole, i.e. a wormhole which could connect two different parts of the same universe or of different universes. Later, Einstein and Rosen explored it further to what we know now as the Einstein-Rosen bridge.
				</p>
				<p>
				While black holes and wormholes are usually represented in art or fiction, white holes on their own are rarely pictured. The theme of this contest is focused on white holes but black holes and wormholes will be accepted too.
				</p>
